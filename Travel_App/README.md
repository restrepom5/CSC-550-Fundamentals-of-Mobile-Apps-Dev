FINAL PROJECT: Travel & Wellness Tracker (Ian Cheung Final)Project OverviewThis application is designed to help users track their trips and manage their emotional wellness while traveling. It combines traditional travel planning features with a comprehensive mood logging system, utilizing local storage (Redux/Async Storage) and device capabilities to provide a holistic travel companion.📈 Performance ConsiderationsOne potential performance bottleneck in the Mood Tracker screen is the re-rendering and sorting of the entire list of mood entries every time a new mood is added or if the Redux state updates for any reason. If the user logs hundreds of mood entries, sorting a large array ([...moodEntries].sort()) and generating dozens of React Native <MoodCard> components on every update could cause noticeable lag or frame drops, especially on older devices.I would use the React DevTools Profiler (accessible via Flipper) to inspect this. I would look for the time spent in the render phase of the MoodTrackerScreen and check the "Why did this render?" feature to confirm if unrelated props are causing unnecessary updates.One optimization I would apply is memoization using React.memo around the MoodCard component. This prevents individual mood entries from re-rendering unless their specific entry prop changes. Furthermore, I would use useMemo in the MoodTrackerScreen to memoize the sortedEntries array, ensuring the heavy sorting operation only runs when the raw moodEntries array actually changes, thus avoiding redundant sorting during other state updates (like navigation or unrelated Redux changes).
