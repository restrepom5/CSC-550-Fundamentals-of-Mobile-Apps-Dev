# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

One potential performance bottleneck in this app is scrolling through a long list of food reviews on the Reviews screen. As the number of reviews grows, each item (with text, styling, and layout) adds work to the JS and UI threads, which can lead to janky or sluggish scrolling on lower-end devices. I inspected this behavior using the React DevTools Profiler and by watching how the app felt when rapidly scrolling a large list of reviews in the Android emulator.

To help with this, I use `FlatList` for reviews so that rows are virtualized instead of all rendered at once. In the future, I would further optimize by memoizing review row components, debouncing any filter/search input, and lazy-loading heavier content (like images or extra metadata) to avoid unnecessary re-renders while scrolling.
