# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

### 📈 Performance Considerations


A potential performance issue that I have found is when calling the API. This application relys on phone location to provide the weather, but every time a reset my emulator the location gets reset and the app can not get the proper latitude and longitude.

It could be a serious problem for real scenario deployment. I can affect the user experience and waste of phone resources. 

I used React DevTools profiler to see how the perfomrace is affected. What I notice was how time cosuming was this process for the app. 
addiotnally, I frequinetly use console.log to troubleshoot my app from the terminal. 

Optimization: 
A work around for this problem was to create a fallback API call wiht a preset location. That way, if the phone location can not be fetched, the app will use a default city, in my case, New Haven.
