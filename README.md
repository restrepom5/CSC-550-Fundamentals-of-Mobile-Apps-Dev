📈 Performance Considerations
One potential performance bottleneck in the HealthLibrary screen is the synchronous filtering logic (healthProblems.filter(...)) running directly within the component render function. This function re-runs on every single character entered into the search input. If the healthProblems array were to grow very large (e.g., hundreds or thousands of entries), the repeated, synchronous string comparison checks could cause a noticeable delay on the JavaScript thread, leading to UI jank and slow input response. This issue would be inspected using the React DevTools Profiler to measure the time spent in the HealthLibrary component during typing, specifically looking for components taking longer than 16ms to render. A crucial optimization we would apply is debouncing the search input using a custom hook (like useDebounce). This would ensure the expensive filtering operation only executes once the user has paused typing for a specified period (e.g., 300ms), significantly reducing unnecessary re-renders and improving the feel of the input.
