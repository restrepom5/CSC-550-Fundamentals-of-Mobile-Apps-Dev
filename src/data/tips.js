    title: 'What is Rope Drop?',
    body:
      'Rope drop means being inside the park right before official opening so you can walk with the first crowd to a big attraction when the paths open. It is usually the lowest wait you will see all day for the most popular rides.',

    id: 'virtual-queue',
    title: 'Virtual Queues & Boarding Groups',
    body:
      'Some rides use virtual queues instead of a traditional line. You tap a button in the park app at a set time, get a return window, and come back when your group is called instead of waiting 90 minutes in the sun.',

    title: 'Use Free Ice Water',
    body:
      'Most quick-service restaurants and many snack stands will give you a free cup of ice water if you ask. Bring a smaller bottle or thermos and dump the cups into it so you have water while walking between lands.',

    title: 'Plan a Midday Break',
    body:
      'Mornings and evenings are the easiest times to tour. Consider rope dropping, leaving around lunch for a nap or pool break, and returning after the worst heat and crowds have passed.',

    title: 'Wear Broken-In Shoes',
    body:
      'Expect to walk 15,000–20,000 steps on a full park day. Wear broken-in sneakers and pack extra socks or blister patches so sore feet do not wreck your trip.',

    title: 'Souvenir Cups vs. Personal Bottle',
    body:
      'Refillable Freestyle cups can save money if you drink lots of soda, but they must be activated for each day you use them. If you mostly want water, consider bringing a thermos for yourself and buying souvenir cups only for the kids.',

    id: 'single-rider',
    title: 'Use Single Rider Lines',
    body:

    title: 'Know the Locker Rules',
    body:
      'On several thrill rides, bags and loose items are not allowed in the queue. Universal provides free short-term lockers, but it is easier if you travel light with a small sling or belt bag.',
